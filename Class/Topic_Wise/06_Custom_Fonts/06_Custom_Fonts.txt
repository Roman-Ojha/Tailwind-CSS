*) Custom Fonts:
    -> tailwind comes with the different fonts as standard, 
    -> you can see that on default config file 
    -> if we want to use our own custom font then we have to extend the theme in our own tailwind config file

    -> first get the link for the font available and past it into 'src/styles.css' file
    -> after importing font link we can now reference that inside our tailwind config file
        ->  fontFamily: {
                    body: ["Nunito", "sans-serif"],
                },
