-> npx tailwindcss init --full
    -> --full = for all of the default value provided by tailwind
-> then it will create a new file called 'tailwind.config.js' file
    -> which contain all of the value related to the classes
-> so, we can change the value of classes that is provided by tailwind and also we can create our own property
    -> and if we will add new property that we again have to build the source file
    -> but to change value in default config is not recommended
    -> instead we should create a blank config file to extend the default rules that way we're not altering the core values and it's easier to see which extra value we've added ourselves as well
    -> so now we will change the name of default config file to 'tailwind-default.config.js'
    -> now we will create new blank config file using:
        -> npx tailwindcss init

-> after adding blank config file now we can extend the default value with new one
    -> now you can extend the property value:
        -> extend: {
            colors: {
                primary: "#FF6353",
                secondary: {
                100: "#E2E2D5",
                200: "#888883",
                },
            },
            },
        -> so when we want to use in to html we have to use it like this now:
            -> <a href="#" class="text-secondary-100">Log in</a>
            -> <div class="bg-secondary-100 text-primary">Load more</div>
