*) to make responsive we just prefix our tailwind classes with responsive classes and then that classes would only apply to that screen size and up
    -> EX:
        -> theme:{
            screens:{
                'md':'768',
            }
        }
        if we prefix classes with: 'md' it means that we are just applying that class on that particular size
        -> <div class="bg-green-500 md:bg-red-500 lg:bg-green-500"></div>
