*) What is Tailwind CSS?
    -> CSS framework made up of utility classes
    -> Much lower-level then bootstrap,Materialize etc..
    -> Tailwind CSS is basically a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override
    -> So, we make our own design based on low level utility classes

*) Setup:
    -> Install tailwind using npm(node package manager)
    -> on Project directory:
        -> npm init -y
        -> npm i tailwindcss


*) how does tailwind work?
    -> when we will use tailwind we create source file where we import all of the tailwind course styles and functionality
    -> and we can also write our own CSS if we want to inside this file using tailwind feature and syntax as well
    -> then we will use tailwind to process that source file into a vanilla CSS output file at a Build time with all of the file CSS rules inside it
    -> so, when every time we make change on source css file we have to make tailwind script to process that into a new output css file

*) Project overview
    -> so let's make our source folder and public folder
    -> source folder will have all source file
    -> public folder is where our final output CSS is going to go after tailwind had processed it
    -> So first create 'style.css' file on 'src' folder and past :
            ->  @tailwind base;
                @tailwind components;
                @tailwind utilities;
    -> then we will make script on package.json to build tailwind css:
            -> "scripts": {
    "build-css": "tailwindcss -i <directory_where_src_file_exist> -o <directory_where_final_css_file_goes> --watch"
  },
    -> then run:
        -> npm run build-css
    -> so when  we will add some css code on 'src/styles.css' file tailwind reprocess that css and create the build css file 
    -> But, on most cases we don't usually write css code on 'src/style.css' file we will use html utility classes
    -> on the project directory run:
        -> npx tailwindcss init
            -> this will initialize the new blank 'tailwind.config.js' where for the new update we have to add 
                -> content: ["<path_of_html_template_and_javascript_component>/**/*.{html,js}"],

->https://tailwindcss.com/
    -> go to https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn
    -> and copy and past on index.html:
        -> <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
